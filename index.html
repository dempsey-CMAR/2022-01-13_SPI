# **MOTIVATION &amp; BACKGROUND**

???
- Hello folks, and Happy New Year.
- For those of you I haven't met, my name is Danielle Dempsey. I am the Research Fellow in Coastal Oceanography at CMAR.
- Today I'm going to tell you about a paper that Gregor and I and some other folks have been working on.
- The title is kind of a mouthful:
- This is the first time we've shared these results, so they are "hot off the press" and may change a little as we get feedback from folks like yourselves, but I definitely think it's worth sharing at this stage. 

**
- I'll start with discussing the motivation for the paper, and then talk about the model we used before jumping into the analysis and results.

- As you know, cultured salmon are grown on land in fresh water for the first part of their life, and then transferred to salt water farms when they become smolt.

---
# Motivation

- Recent trend in Atlantic salmon aquaculture to stock large post-smolts (~ 1 kg) 
--

- Mainly to reduce disease potential 
--

- Could also enable grow-out to market size in less than a year

**Potential for novel sites in areas typically considered unsuitable for aquaculture**
]

???
- As you know, cultured salmon are grown on land in fresh water for the first part of their life, and then transferred to salt water farms when they become smolt.

- Typically this happens when the smolt are about 100 to 150 g

- There has been a recent trend in the industry to stock post-smolts that are closer to 500 g or even a full 1 kg.

- This strategy has primarily been implemented to reduce disease potential, and has also been used to reduce grow-out time.

- Depending on local temperature and initial fish size, large post-smolt stocking could enable grow-out to target market weights in less than a year

- Which could open up novel sites in areas that are typically considered unsuitable for aquaculture because they experience seasonal superchill.



- Smoltification is when salmon change lifestages from being “parr” in freshwater to “smolts” adapted to saltwater.

Norway:
Prior to January 2013, the maximum allowable juvenile weight was 250 g. In January 2013, this value was changed to 1 kg, increasing the flexibility of the production process. 

- Larger smolts are increasingly popular in Norway, where licences for extra biomass are limited and expensive, in Tasmania, and to an increasing extent in Scotland.


---
# How big does a post-smolt salmon need to be &lt;br/&gt; to grow to market size at a given location?

Thermal Growth Coefficient (TGC) model

$$
w_0 = (w_t^{1/3} - \frac{TGC}{1000} * degreedays)^3
$$

`$$degreedays = T_{Avg} * n_{days}$$`
--

- `\(w_0\)` = initial stocking weight (kg) -&gt; **?**

- `\(w_t\)` = final weight after grow-out (kg) -&gt; **5.5 kg**

- `\(TGC\)` = thermal growth coefficient -&gt; **remedial = 0.25, average = 0.30, elite = 0.35**

- `\(degreedays\)` = degree days experienced by fish over growing season -&gt; **empirical data**

???
- And so the question we are asking in this paper is....
- To explore this question, we are using the thermal growth coefficient model, which relates the initial weight and final weight of a fish based on the average temperature over a period of time

- For our analysis, we want to calculate the initial weight
- The final weight is market size, which we assumed to be 5.5 kg
- The TGC is a coefficient that has been determined from other studies. Here we are testing three values to get an idea of the sensitivity: one that represents a slowing-growing or "remedial" stock; one to represent an average stock, and one to represent a fast-growing or "elite" stock
- Finally, the degree-days are calculated as the average temperature over a given number of growing days. What is really exciting and unique about this paper is that we have empirical data that we can use to calculate degree-days for different locations around NS

- As a quick reminder, CMAR coordinates an extensive Coastal Monitoring Program that includes high resolution temperature monitoring.
- We also measure dissolved oxygen and sometimes salinity at these locations, but temperature is the important one for this analysis.
- So far we have processed data from 190 deployments at 86 different locations, which you can see in the figure here
- We have pretty good coverage around the province, particularly along the Eastern Shore up to Guysborough county, and over in St. Marys Bay.

- Here is an example of temperature data from Flat Island in Lunenburg County, just outside of Mahone Bay.
- This is data for about 3.5 years, from May 2018 to November 2021
- There are 5 different depths, represented by colour
- You can see the temperature is pretty well stratified in the summmer months, but is much more well mixed in the winter.

- Just another quick example. 
- This is for Beaver Point on the Eastern Shore of Halifax county. 
- Nearly 4 years of data for 4 different depths

- The first thing I did was tell the code to look through all the temperature data from all of the locations we just saw and assign growing seasons, i.e., a date when fish could theoretically be put into the water, and when they would be removed.
- Based on advice provided by Roland, the season starts when the temperature exceeds the 4-degree threshold, which is marked by the dashed grey line in the figure, and doesn't go back down below it, 
- The season ends at the first observation before superchill, which is indicated by the blue shaded region.
- If there is no superchill, then the season ends after 18 months


- This figure shows one season of data for Beaver Point.

- I realize that it is not 

- Obviously it is much easier to define the seasons this way in retrospect  

- did this for all stations + depths

# Thermal Growth Coefficient Model

Relates initial weight and final weight based on the average temperature over a period of time

$$
w_0 = (w_t^{1/3} - \frac{TGC}{1000} * degreedays)^3
$$

`$$degreedays = T_{Avg} * n_{days}$$`
--

- `\(w_0\)` = initial stocking weight (kg)
- `\(w_t\)` = final weight after grow-out (kg)
- `\(TGC\)` = thermal growth coefficient (remedial = 0.25, average = 0.30, elite = 0.35)
- `\(degreedays\)` = degree days experienced by fish over growing season
- `\(T_{Avg}\)` = average temperature over the growing season*
- `\(n_{days}\)` = number of days in the growing season*

*Assume no growth for 24 hours after observation `\(\ge\)` 18 degrees Celsius

ALT text: How big does a post-smolt salmon need to be to grow out to market size at a given location?


- To explore this potential, we are using the thermal growth coefficient model

- Common model that relates final weight and initial weight of a fish based on the average temperature it experiences over a given period of time

(observations in this window are removed and not included in `\(T_{Avg}\)` or `\(n_{days}\)`)
