# **MOTIVATION & BACKGROUND**

???
- Hello folks, and Happy New Year.
- For those of you I haven't met, my name is Danielle Dempsey. I am the Research Fellow in Coastal Oceanography at CMAR.
- Today I'm going to tell you about a paper that Gregor and I and some other folks have been working on.
- The title is kind of a mouthful:
- This is the first time we've shared these results, so they are "hot off the press" and may change a little as we get feedback from folks like yourselves, but I definitely think it's worth sharing at this stage. 

**
- I'll start with discussing the motivation for the paper, and then talk about the model we used before jumping into the analysis and results.

- As you know, cultured salmon are grown on land in fresh water for the first part of their life, and then transferred to salt water farms when they become smolt.

---
# Motivation

- Recent trend in Atlantic salmon aquaculture to stock large post-smolts (~ 1 kg) 
--

- Mainly to reduce disease potential 
--

- Could also enable net pen grow-out to market size in less than a year
--

.pull-center[
**Potential for novel sites in areas previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture**
]

???
- As you know, cultured salmon are grown on land in fresh water for the first part of their life, and then transferred to salt water farms when they become smolt.

- Typically this happens when the smolt are about 100 to 150 g

- There has been a recent trend in the industry to stock post-smolts that are closer to 500 g or even a full 1 kg.

- This strategy has primarily been implemented to reduce disease potential, and has also been used to reduce grow-out time.

- Depending on local temperature and initial fish size, large post-smolt stocking could enable grow-out to target market weights in less than a year

- Which could open up novel sites in areas that are typically considered unsuitable for aquaculture because they experience seasonal superchill.



- Smoltification is when salmon change lifestages from being “parr” in freshwater to “smolts” adapted to saltwater.

Norway:
Prior to January 2013, the maximum allowable juvenile weight was 250 g. In January 2013, this value was changed to 1 kg, increasing the flexibility of the production process. 

- Larger smolts are increasingly popular in Norway, where licences for extra biomass are limited and expensive, in Tasmania, and to an increasing extent in Scotland.


---
# How big does a post-smolt salmon need to be <br/> to grow to market size at a given location?

Thermal Growth Coefficient (TGC) model

$$
w_0 = (w_t^{1/3} - \frac{TGC}{1000} * degreedays)^3
$$

$$degreedays = T_{Avg} * n_{days}$$
--

- $w_0$ = initial stocking weight (kg) -> **?**

- $w_t$ = final weight after grow-out (kg) -> **5.5 kg**

- $TGC$ = thermal growth coefficient -> **remedial = 0.25, average = 0.30, elite = 0.35**

- $degreedays$ = degree days experienced by fish over growing season -> **empirical data**

???
- And so the question we are asking in this paper is....
- To explore this question, we are using the thermal growth coefficient model, which relates the initial weight and final weight of a fish based on the average temperature over a period of time

- For our analysis, we want to calculate the initial weight
- The final weight is market size, which we assumed to be 5.5 kg
- The TGC is a coefficient that has been determined from other studies. Here we are testing three values to get an idea of the sensitivity: one that represents a slowing-growing or "remedial" stock; one to represent an average stock, and one to represent a fast-growing or "elite" stock
- Finally, the degree-days are calculated as the average temperature over a given number of growing days. What is really exciting and unique about this paper is that we have empirical data that we can use to calculate degree-days for different locations around NS

# Coastal Monitoring Program

- High resolution monitoring of **temperature** (plus dissolved oxygen & some salinity)
- Processed 190 deployments from 86 locations

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.6}

all_stations <- read_csv(
  here("data/Station_Locations_2021-12-21.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)

all_stations %>% 
  mutate(
    COUNTY = paste("County:", COUNTY),
    WATERBODY = paste("Waterbody:", WATERBODY),
    STATION = paste("Station:", STATION),
    LABEL = paste(COUNTY, WATERBODY, STATION, sep = "</br>")
  ) %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)%>%
  addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup = ~LABEL)

```

???
- As a quick reminder, CMAR coordinates an extensive Coastal Monitoring Program that includes high resolution temperature monitoring.
- We also measure dissolved oxygen and sometimes salinity at these locations, but temperature is the important one for this analysis.
- So far we have processed data from 190 deployments at 86 different locations, which you can see in the figure here
- We have pretty good coverage around the province, particularly along the Eastern Shore up to Guysborough county, and over in St. Marys Bay.

- Here is an example of temperature data from Flat Island in Lunenburg County, just outside of Mahone Bay.
- This is data for about 3.5 years, from May 2018 to November 2021
- There are 5 different depths, represented by colour
- You can see the temperature is pretty well stratified in the summmer months, but is much more well mixed in the winter.

- Just another quick example. 
- This is for Beaver Point on the Eastern Shore of Halifax county. 
- Nearly 4 years of data for 4 different depths

# **ANALYSIS & RESULTS**

Identify Growing Seasons

- Season end: before temperature crosses superchill threshold OR after 18 months

- The first thing I did was tell the code to look through all the temperature data from all of the locations we just saw and assign growing seasons, i.e., a date when fish could theoretically be put into the water, and when they would be removed.
- Based on advice provided by Roland, the season starts when the temperature exceeds the 4-degree threshold, which is marked by the dashed grey line in the figure, and doesn't go back down below it, 
- The season ends at the first observation before superchill, which is indicated by the blue shaded region.
- If there is no superchill, then the season ends after 18 months


- This figure shows one season of data for Beaver Point.

- I realize that it is not 

- Obviously it is much easier to define the seasons this way in retrospect  

- did this for all stations + depths

  - Short season (< 8.5 months)

- Next, I wanted to choose three example stations to focus on for the paper, representing a short, medium, and long growing season.
- I applied a few other criteria, including filtering out any seasons that had prolonged data gaps
- and only keeping stations with data for 2, 5, and 10 m to facilitate comparison

- At the end of this exercise, I chose Flat Island to represent a long season, Beaver Point for a medium season, and Madeline Point as a short season

- The next step was to calculate the number of growing days at each station, for the degree-day calculation
- We assumed that there would be no growth for 24 hours after the temperature exceeded 18 degrees Celcius, as illustrated in this figure.

- This is data from Madeline Point, our example of a short growing season. All of the observations greater than 18 degrees C, in the red part of the figure AND 24 hours after were filtered out of the analysis and not included in the average temperature OR number of degree days

- 31 days filtered out for 2 m depth; only 3.5 filtered out at 22 m

- $degreedays$ = degree days experienced by fish over growing season
- $T_{Avg}$ = average temperature over the growing season*
- $n_{days}$ = number of days in the growing season*

*Assume no growth for 24 hours after observation $\ge$ 18 degrees Celsius

ALT text: How big does a post-smolt salmon need to be to grow out to market size at a given location?


- To explore this potential, we are using the thermal growth coefficient model

- Common model that relates final weight and initial weight of a fish based on the average temperature it experiences over a given period of time

(observations in this window are removed and not included in $T_{Avg}$ or $n_{days}$)
