# **MOTIVATION & BACKGROUND**

???
- Hello folks, and Happy New Year.
- For those of you I haven't met, my name is Danielle Dempsey. I am the Research Fellow in Coastal Oceanography at CMAR.
- Today I'm going to tell you about a paper that Gregor and I and some other folks have been working on.
- The title is kind of a mouthful:
- This work is hot off the press - this is the first time we've shared these results, so I'm looking forward to showing you and getting some feedback at the end.

**
- I'll start at the beginning with the motivation for the paper

- As you know, cultured salmon are grown on land in fresh water for the first part of their life, and then transferred to salt water farms when they become smolt.

---
# Motivation

- Cultured salmon are transferred from land to net pens when they become smolts (~150 g)

- Recent trend in Atlantic salmon aquaculture to stock large post-smolts (~ 1 kg)

  - Proposed land-based facilities in Nova Scotia that could grow post-smolts up to 1.5 kg

- Mainly to reduce disease potential 

- Could also enable net pen grow-out to market size in less than a year

**Potential for novel sites in areas previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture**
]

???
- As you know, cultured salmon are grown in land-based facilities in fresh water for the first part of their life, and then transferred to salt water farms when they become smolt.

- Typically this happens when the fish are about 100 to 150 g

- There has been a recent trend in the industry to stock post-smolts that are closer to 500 g or even a full 1 kg. There proposed facilities in NS with the potential to grow post-smolts on land up to 1.5 kg

- This large post-smolt stocking strategy has primarily been implemented to reduce disease potential

- Depending on local temperature and initial fish size, large post-smolt stocking could enable net pen grow-out to market size in less than a year

- Which could open up novel sites in areas that were previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture, for example because they experience seasonal superchill.


Norway:
Prior to January 2013, the maximum allowable juvenile weight was 250 g. In January 2013, this value was changed to 1 kg, increasing the flexibility of the production process. 

- Larger smolts are increasingly popular in Norway, where licences for extra biomass are limited and expensive, in Tasmania, and to an increasing extent in Scotland.

---
# How big does a post-smolt salmon need to be <br/> to grow to market size at a given location?

Thermal Growth Coefficient (TGC) model

$$
w_0 = (w_t^{1/3} - \frac{TGC}{1000} * degreedays)^3
$$

$$degreedays = T_{Avg} * n_{days}$$
--

- $w_0$ = initial stocking weight (kg) -> **?**

- $w_t$ = final weight after grow-out (kg) -> **5.5 kg**

- $TGC$ = thermal growth coefficient -> **remedial = 0.25, average = 0.30, elite = 0.35**

- $degreedays$ = degree days experienced by fish over growing season -> **empirical data**

???
- And so the question we are asking in this paper is....
- To explore this question, we are using the thermal growth coefficient model, which relates the initial weight and final weight of a fish based on the average temperature over a period of time

- For our analysis, we want to calculate the initial weight
- The final weight is market size, which we assumed to be 5.5 kg
- The TGC is a coefficient that has been determined from other studies. Here we are testing three values to get an idea of the sensitivity: one that represents a slowing-growing or "remedial" stock; one to represent an average stock, and one to represent a fast-growing or "elite" stock
- Finally, the degree-days are calculated as the average temperature over a given number of growing days. What is really exciting and unique about this paper is that we have empirical data that we can use to calculate degree-days for different locations around NS

# Coastal Monitoring Program

- High resolution monitoring of **temperature** (plus dissolved oxygen & some salinity)
- Processed 190 deployments from 86 locations

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.6}

all_stations <- read_csv(
  here("data/Station_Locations_2021-12-21.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)

all_stations %>% 
  mutate(
    COUNTY = paste("County:", COUNTY),
    WATERBODY = paste("Waterbody:", WATERBODY),
    STATION = paste("Station:", STATION),
    LABEL = paste(COUNTY, WATERBODY, STATION, sep = "</br>")
  ) %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)%>%
  addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup = ~LABEL)

```

???
- As a quick reminder, CMAR coordinates an extensive Coastal Monitoring Program that includes high resolution temperature monitoring.
- We also measure dissolved oxygen and sometimes salinity at these locations, but temperature is the important one for this analysis.
- So far we have processed data from 190 deployments at 86 different locations, which you can see in the figure here
- We have pretty good coverage around the province, particularly along the Eastern Shore up to Guysborough county, and over in St. Marys Bay.

- Here is an example of temperature data from Flat Island in Lunenburg County, just outside of Mahone Bay.
- This is data for about 3.5 years, from May 2018 to November 2021
- Temperaure was measured by sensors at 5 different depths, represented by colour
- You can see the temperature is pretty well stratified in the summmer months, but is much more well mixed in the winter.

- Just another quick example. 
- This is for Beaver Point on the Eastern Shore of Halifax county. 
- Nearly 4 years of data for 4 different depths

# **ANALYSIS & RESULTS**

???
- Now I'm going to move into some of the details of our analysis and preliminary results

Identify Growing Seasons

Choose Example Stations

Calculate Degree-Days

Apply TGC Model

# Identify Growing Seasons

- Season start: temperature crosses the 4-degree trending up threshold
- Season end: before temperature crosses superchill threshold OR after 18 months

  filter(STATION == "Beaver Point") %>% 
  plot_temperature_at_depth(legend_drop = TRUE,
                            date_breaks_major = "2 month",
                            date_labels_format = "%Y-%b-%d") +

???
- The first thing I did was tell the code to look through all the temperature data from all of the 86 locations we just saw and assign growing seasons, i.e., a date when fish could theoretically be put into the water, and when they would be removed.
- This figure shows one season of data for Beaver Point.
- Based on advice provided by Roland, each season starts when the temperature exceeds 4-degree and doesn't go back down below it.
- 4-degree threshold is marked in dotted grey line
- In this example...
- The season ends at the first observation before superchill, which is indicated by the blue shaded region.
- If there is no superchill, then the season ends after 18 months

- In this table, we can get a more detailed sense of when the season starts and ends, and the theoretical number of stocked days.
- So at the 2 m depth, fish could be stock for 276 days, but down at 15 m this is reduced to 193 days

- Next, I wanted to choose three example stations to focus on for the paper, representing a short, medium, and long growing season.
- I applied a few other criteria, including filtering out any seasons that had prolonged data gaps
- and only keeping stations with data for 2, 5, and 10 m to facilitate comparison

- At the end of this exercise, I chose Flat Island to represent a long season, Beaver Point for a medium season, and Madeline Point as a short season

- No superchill at Flat Island

- The next step was to calculate the number of growing days at each station and depth, for the degree-day calculation
- We assumed that there would be no growth for 24 hours after the temperature exceeded 18 degrees Celcius, due to heat stress. 

- As illustrated in this figure.

- This is data from Beaver Point, our medium growing season. All of the observations greater than 18 degrees C, in  AND 24 hours after were filtered out of the analysis and not included in the average temperature OR number of growing days

- 26 days filtered out for 2 m depth; only 5 filtered out at 15 m
- Flat Island: Heat stress at 2 m

- Very little variation at depth at Madeline Point because not a lot of stratifications
- Same number of degree days for 5 and 10 m at Madeline Point and Beaver Point, even though Madeline Point season was about a month shorter
- Because the average temperature was about a degree warmer at Madeline Point

- Flat Island: fewer degree-days at 2 m than 5 or 10 m because of the heat stress we saw on the previous slide.

- That brings us to our model results, and back to our original question of...

- This figure shows the model results, with a panel for each example station.

- Recall we looked at three different TGC values, one for a slow growing stock, one for an average stock, and one for a fast growing stock

- if we take a look at Madeline Point, our shortest season, assuming a fast-growing stock, a 1.5 kg smolt could theoretically grow out to market size in just over 8 months.

- this was an exciting results, because as I mentioned at the beginning, there are proposed facilities in NS that could produce super smolts of this size

- Results suggest that smolts around or below 1.5 kg could also grow to market size at the Beaver Point example

- And for Flat Island, our longest season with lots of growing days, we could have much smaller smolts.

- A lot of discussion we could have around the results and implications of this model

Assumptions
- Modelling study, as with any modelling study, there is a need to make assumptions
- e.g., here we assumed fish stay at one depth for the season, and about how they react to heat stress
- I think these are reasonable assumptions and that we can still learn from the results

Inter-annual variability
- Examples from just 1 season at three different sites - not representative of every year at a give site or of any particular region
- We have nearly 4 years of data for some sites, so one thing I'm excited to start doing is to explore this variability to get a better sense of timing of season start and superchill, and how these timings are related spatially
- Operators that they want at least 6 years of data before they make decisions

ALT text: How big does a post-smolt salmon need to be to grow out to market size at a given location?


- To explore this potential, we are using the thermal growth coefficient model

- Common model that relates final weight and initial weight of a fish based on the average temperature it experiences over a given period of time
